It is not working..  they  put him on the Gaba to remove the morphine.  In the last 4 weeks  by 11pm he is wide awake in pain and in tears.  In the last 2 weeks the heavy pressure on  his right side just below the shoulder is worse each time.  He has developed a cold  that will not go away  starting in Nov. We see the Doc on Feb 3rd. He is taking a sleep aid  and med for really bad  headaches.  I am  so  afraid of what will happen when  the next dose falls.   We have been married for 24 years.  He  has had problems with drugs and drink all his life  from 9 years of age on..  yep   .. people  9 years of age..  Started smoking pot and drinking.. \\\"\",\n          \"\\\"So I was prescribed this medication a while ago, but I basically gave up every time things got painful. That for me, was about 5th day in. I&#039;d been told to persevere and that the pain and dryness would stop after the first 2 weeks. But I decided to only use it when I had breakouts. However, this medication brings out the acne before clearing it, so of course your acne is going to get worse before it gets better. \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nHOWEVER, I now use it everyday. I have very sensitive skin so I can&#039;t use a lot of moisturisers because they burn. But I&#039;m using some Garnier moisturiser and an oil based one from lush whenever my skin feels a little dry, and I have not had a painful night since. And no extreme dryness or flaking either.

It was pretty bad and I was immediately put on Paxil but also tried Welbutrin, Celexa, and Trazadone. The last three didn&#039;t really work for me but Paxil in combination with Clonazapam did help me after a period of time. I had some good stretches and some bad ones. In 2010 my doctor suggested Lexapro at 10mg. It was amazing. I felt great and I didn&#039;t need the clonazapam. This lasted for about 2 years but then a few stressful situations made my anxiety and depression come back. My doctor increased Lexapro to 20mg and also put me back on clonazapam. I was on this for about 2 months with no relief.

Before I originally got the first one I did tons of research and discovered that Implanon is a better form of birth control than getting your tubes tied at 1 in 15,000 women getting pregnant when using Implanon where as have your tubes tied is a 1 in 12,000 chance of getting pregnant.

By 11:30 I was fast asleep. Although I woke up a few times throughout the night, as I usually do, I was still tired and found it very easy to fall back to sleep without tossing and turning for ten minutes at a time.
